This repository contains our work for the data challenge of the course "Machine Learning with Kernel Methods" in spring 2022. We used several methods for this challenge, the best results were achieved using Histogram of Oriented Gradients features and a support vector classifier with a Laplacian kernel. These results can be reproduced by running
```
python start.py
```
The other methods we tried are included in the notebooks. They include unsupervised feature extraction from http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/coates11a/coates11a.pdf, as well as denoising using kernel PCA.
